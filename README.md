# ScreenCaster
A ScreenCaster module for taking videos of what's on your screen. 

Because who wants to pay $300 for something you can do yourself?
Just drop the folder in site-packages and it should be importable from there as

'''
import screenCast from ScreenCaster
'''

And then you can use it

'''
screenCast.functionName(parameters)
'''
